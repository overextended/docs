# Getting Started

## MySQL or MariaDB?

Most resources for FiveM were designed to be used with MySQL 5.7 and may hit compatibility issues when using MySQL 8, i.e.

- More reserved keywords, like 'stored' and 'group'.
- Longtext / JSON fields do not support default values.

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) is strongly recommended for compatibility, and improved performance (over all versions of MySQL).

## XAMPP

XAMPP is not a database, and should not be used solely to start your MySQL/MariaDB service. Please _do not_ use XAMPP.

## Installation

- Download the [latest build](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql/releases/latest) of oxmysql (not the source code).
- Extract the contents of the archive to your resources folder.
- Start the resource near the top of your resources in your `server.cfg`.
- If you have a lot of streamed assets, load them first to prevent timing out the connection.

## Configuration

You can change the configuration settings by using convars inside your `server.cfg`.  
Reference the following for an idea of how to set your connection options.  
You must include one of the following lines, adjusted for your connection and database settings.

:::caution
When using convars do not replicate sensitive information to the client.
**set** will only be set on the server, while **setr** is replicated.
:::

```yaml
set mysql_connection_string "mysql://root:12345@localhost:3306/es_extended?charset=utf8mb4"
set mysql_connection_string "user=root;password=12345;host=localhost;port=3306;database=es_extended;charset=utf8mb4"
```

Certain special characters are reserved or blocked and may cause issues when used in your password.  
For more optional settings (such as multiple statements) you can reference [pool.d.ts](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/master/typings/mysql/lib/Pool.d.ts#L10) and [connection.d.ts](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/master/typings/mysql/lib/Connection.d.ts#L8).

You can also add the following convars if you require extra information when testing queries.

```yaml
set mysql_slow_query_warning 150
set mysql_debug true
```

### Debug options

When using the `mysql_debug` convar, rather than setting the value as true, you can send an array and enable debug prints for a set list of resources instead.

```yaml
set mysql_debug [
    "ox_core",
    "ox_inventory"
]
```

This list can be adjusted during runtime with commands, temporarily adding or removing resources until the resource is restarted.

```yaml
oxmysql_debug remove ox_core
oxmysql_debug add ox_core
```

### Debug UI

Debug UI is used to see your total query number, speeds, per resource queries and their speeds, etc...

You can read more about using the debug UI on the [Using the Debug UI](/docs/oxmysql/Getting%20Started/ui) page

## Compatibility

You shouldn't run multiple mysql resources to ensure the best experience.  
The resources listed below can be deleted to allow oxmysql to handle the events, without any changes.

### mysql-async

Standard API for mysql-async uses `server_script '@mysql-async/lib/MySQL.lua'`.  
Raw exports, mostly used in resources written in JavaScript or C#, are _not supported_.

### ghmattimysql

As of v2.4.0, oxmysql can be utilised with ghmattimysql's exports, such as `exports.ghmattimysql:execute`.
