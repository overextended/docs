## Creator codes

Creator codes allow Tebex stores to share a percentage of a purchase with us, while giving a discount to the customer. We make these deals to advertise trusted creators who meet our criteria.

- Resources are highly configurable or, preferably, source-available.
- We trust that customers will be given assistance.
- The creator is a known member of our community.
